### GitHub Repository: **Elon Musk Mimic AI**

#### **Overview**
This repository contains the code, data, and workflows for the **Elon Musk Mimic AI** project. The project aims to create a conversational AI chatbot that replicates Elon Musk's communication style, leveraging data from his tweets, YouTube transcripts, and other sources. It includes a full data pipeline, machine learning models, and embedding generation.

#### **Repository Structure**

1. **Data Files**:
   - **`cleaned_elonmusk_tweets.txt`**: 
     - A preprocessed dataset containing Elon Musk's cleaned tweets, stripped of URLs, special characters, and unnecessary text. Used for training and fine-tuning NLP models.
   - **`sentiment_analysis.csv`**:
     - Sentiment scores derived from the cleaned tweet data. Includes polarity values for sentiment analysis.
   - **`bert_embeddings.csv`**:
     - Precomputed embeddings for Elon Musk’s text using BERT. These embeddings are crucial for understanding the semantic context of the text.
   - **`word2vec_vectors.txt`**:
     - Word2Vec-generated word embeddings based on Elon Musk's tweets and transcripts. Provides word-level contextual understanding.
   - **`elonmusk_polititweet.csv`**:
     - The raw dataset scraped from Polititweet.org, containing Elon Musk's tweets with metadata such as date and source.
   - **`youtube_transcripts.txt`**:
     - Transcripts from Elon Musk’s YouTube videos, cleaned and formatted for NLP processing.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - **`clean the text_Integrate_streamlit.ipynb`**:
     - A notebook that integrates text cleaning with a Streamlit application for real-time text processing demonstrations.
   - **`Youtube transcript embeddings.ipynb`**:
     - Processes YouTube transcripts to generate embeddings using BERT and Word2Vec.
   - **`twitter_scrape.ipynb`**:
     - Contains the web scraping code to fetch Elon Musk’s tweets from Twitter and Polititweet.org.
   - **`Push the polititweet file to GCP.ipynb`**:
     - Demonstrates the pipeline for uploading data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for further processing.

3. **Pipeline Scripts**:
   - These scripts handle data ingestion, transformation, and upload processes, as well as embedding generation and sentiment analysis.
