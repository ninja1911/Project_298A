thecryptojourno platformer The source of the bogus Platformer article is a disgruntled employee who had been on paid time off for months had already accepted a job at Google and felt the need to poison the well on the way out Twitter will be taking legal action against him
For example despite having M fewer followers back then I have yet to come anywhere close to this gem

araghougassian Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets just as is done for videos You will sometimes have a video view count of M with only k likes
araghougassian Spooks The problem is that likes are public subjecting people to criticism and like is often the wrong description as you often just think something is interesting or notable but not likable We need to add these critical distinctions

nichegamer brandonorselli semaforben Thats why he wont answer
semaforben To be direct the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill
semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company but he did not do so Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did when in fact he owns For the last time how much of you does SBF own Stop dodging the question

WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website
schrep There are microservices server side of which are critical to Twitter working at all according to server control team Trimming down that number reducing data usage serialized trips simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use

hankgreen Like most people in America I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies but not all However if executive and legislative branches are dominated by one party then we lose balance of power

Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side so independent voters are the ones who actually decide whos in charge
To independentminded voters Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress given that the Presidency is Democratic
But if Twitter is bird thats means

alexavoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced And these are very early days As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth it will be indispensable
BillyMk StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym The highlevel principle is just that verified users cant engage in malicious deception
dogeofficialceo EvaFoxU kylaschwaberow
EvaFoxU kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization
Widespread verification will democratize journalism empower the voice of the people
catturd No exceptions
Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
Previously we issued a warning before suspension but now that we are rolling out widespread verification there will be no warning This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue

Going forward any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying parody will be permanently suspended

kadubai spideycyp But hey look on the bright side At least Russia doesnt get Crimea in that scenario so you can be comforted by that thought while watching the mushroom clouds rise
kadubai spideycyp If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO they will use nukes then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over
spideycyp Whether one likes it or not Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia as it is their southern navy base From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii Pearl Harbor
hyiki spideycyp Exactly

main goals this year Starship to orbit FSD wide release Many other things of course but those are the giant kahunas Will require insane work by many super talented people but if anyone can do it they can It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings

chazman aelluswamy Glad its working out Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve Thats what field testing is all about This early version of is being extra cautious so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic
chazman aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla softwareAI team is who really deserves the credit The talent level at Tesla is incredible
Note you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in mins via the Tesla app
After wide release of FSD Beta price of FSD will rise to k in North America on September th Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept th but delivered later
FSD Beta started rolling out to Tesla owners last night This build is a big step forward probably end of week with wider release in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants
BLKMDL Tesla Tesla AutopilotAI team did great work with Some point releases needed for polish so should really shine

mrgreyev DirtyTesla Tesla When we need strange training examples eg half a car on highway Tesla sim delivers Also accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer so we need more close call examples For safety tests Autopilot sees dummy far away Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers

DirtyTesla Tesla Yeah its nextlevel will just keep getting better with more training data from fleet Tesla sim team is also crushing it
AngelNDevil torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice just work on saving the things I love
AngelNDevil torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA still has a monopoly carveout for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should This is obviously not real competition
torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in when it got a solesource uncompeted B DoD launch contract In any event expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter
SciGuySpace True
thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road th Tower segment added
AstroElliott LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry tons of payload it is not clear that cost per ton to orbitmoonMars improves with a larger rocket Aircraft for example have moved away from A to which has tons of payload
TomCross Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow
LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass X but difficulty of simultaneously building launching rocket of that size is X In retrospect m diameter for Starship might have been wise Current size is ton stack mass tonF thrust which is more than double Saturn V

AstroKevin torybruno ChadBowman thesheetztweetz Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA
torybruno ChadBowman thesheetztweetz Now this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts everyone knows it However in this case it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary which is the goal of SpaceX vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed Boeing Not ok
dogeofficialceo torybruno ChadBowman thesheetztweetz Yeah but dogz rl

ajtourville The Plaid carbonwrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere We have to keep some secrets We have a few ideas for increasing torque max rpm even further for new Roadster Definitely fun exciting engineering ahead
ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal usually high strength steel Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM as carbon sleeve mostly stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration
ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator

annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as kW continuous double that in peak power at C ambient temp In house power vernacular this translates to LRA soft start of ton HVAC Two Powerwalls would double this three would triple etc
Powerwall peak steady power capability is better than advertised Now that we have lots of operational data Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month Depending on production date power increase power may be at C ambient temp
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall Powerwall will interface only between utility meter house main breaker panel enabling super simple install seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts
Starting next week Tesla Solar Panels Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product with Tesla Powerwall battery

RationalEtienne ryaneshea Note this is not the spike protein They dont consider that reliable
RationalEtienne ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab Their main PCR search is for the N gene unique to cov N is also sought but is generic to other sars viruses High PCR cycle count does give false positives but they believe accuracy is good below cycles cycles is their max
PPathole Strange
ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold flu prevalence vs prior years If someone comes in with coldflu symptoms falsely tests positive for cov they will assume they have it when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal coldflu
ryaneshea Moreover lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be This sounds obvious but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low
ryaneshea From

Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry Whats the approximate false positive rate all things considered for cov PCR tests
ClareCraigPath Interesting
johnbeans DirtyTesla Interesting
What is the general population no knowledge of symptoms accuracy of a sarscov PCR test is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles
PPathole cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov spike proteins although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too Hard to get a straight answer False positives will roughly scale with of tests daily test rate has gone ballistic

JohnGardi SciGuySpace Also insulation of a deep cryogen which Id call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka of air is heavy prone to heat leaks H is hell
Tesla factory workplace safety is better than industry average for manufacturers improving fast
Erdayastronaut SciGuySpace Important technical note due to higher OF of CH vs RP oxygen is dense significant density increase of subcooled CH plus no common dome insulation needed plus cryo strength bump of CH tank mass of CHO stage is almost same as RPO
Erdayastronaut SciGuySpace We could never reach Isp with RPkerosene CH has higher Isp potential on paper but even better in practice With CH you can reach of max theoretical combustion efficiency but RP is on a good day requires desooting of turbines between flights
After which they are recycled

PeterJBeck thesheetztweetz ulalaunch torybruno SpaceX would be impressive Anything below a payload hit would be outstanding
Erdayastronaut I sure hope so This will inspire the world get people excited about the future just as Apollo did It wasnt just that a few people went to the moon they went there for all humankind
WhatsupFranks flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying with covid is not same as dying from covid Media keeps reporting former not latter
InSpaceXItrust jgrano Maybe change to interior dimensions Still very roomy
jgrano Probably to months
flcnhvy Moreover there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator but not invasive that tells you something This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ventilator but makes many good points
flcnhvy Youd think theyd at least be Wikipedialevel informed about ventilators It clearly articulates the difference between invasive noninvasive Its very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are real ventilators

chraveesh Teslarati Yes were tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering building a heavy duty planisher to flatten cold work the weld area
Teslarati That said although substantial capital engineering is required to achieve extreme precision marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be less than a water tower because its built inside a factory in volume

Erdayastronaut BocaChicaGal NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps pressurestabilizerelieve compression load on the cylinder walls
Erdayastronaut BocaChicaGal NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to bar which is pretty good as bar is needed for orbital flight With more precise parts better welding conditions we should reach bar which is the factor of safety needed for crewed flight

Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important
SmileSimplify Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed fairly clean room environment for SN in Jan although unlike aluminum stainless steel welding is not super sensitive Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy which affects weld arc steel melt pool
Erdayastronaut No will be autogenous from the start tapping hot CH O from Raptor
teslaownersSV TonyCrisostomo Erdayastronaut Yeah
Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld but we need more precise parts fixtures Hopefully get that done in
Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different These parts are stamped vs manually bumpformed TIP TIG welded vs flux core Higher precision stronger joints mass reduction

bluemoondance flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant Other variants will have throttle
bluemoondance flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year so up to engines per year Most will be the as high as ton thrust but no throttle no gimbal variant for Super Heavy Cumulative thrustyear could thus be as high as tonsyear
bluemoondance flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly Probably wouldnt consider it to be even V until roughly engine although probably engines can be retrofitted for orbital flight especially on Super Heavy which is less sensitive to engine variation It just needs crazy up force
jchybow teslaownersSV flcnhvy Pretty much
leocadle teslaownersSV flcnhvy Exactly Its also a far more exciting inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event however far in the future that may be hopefully very far
teslaownersSV flcnhvy No in the beginning assuming you even make it there alive Mars will be far more dangerous difficult than Earth take decades of hard labor to make selfsufficient Thats the sales pitch Want to go

flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons so vehicles each does tons to orbit thats a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year

teslaownersSV Kristennetten ModelOwners Should note that these product mix logistics errors also results in regional undersupply eg UK Ireland right now but we dont raise the prices even so The intent at any given moment in time is heads we lose tails buyers win
teslaownersSV Kristennetten ModelOwners Thats not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous possibly overstepping our core principles which is why Im looking into it
teslaownersSV Kristennetten ModelOwners At end of quarter there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global regions due to planning mistakes logistics problems Earth is a big place Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supplydemand imbalances
Kristennetten ModelOwners The fundamental operating principle is that prices while they may change will change for all equally should never be a function of bargaining This is normal for most products but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world

FredericLambert Fred every fire is investigated Problem is those who only write about injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article misleading readers into thinking EVs have high fire risk when opposite is true
teslaownersSV jeffleach Thanks support super appreciated
jeffleach Sad if true
When you read double standard articles about Tesla please ask why Maybe theres a good reason that isnt obvious
Reality is a Tesla like most electric cars is over less likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel Why is this never mentioned
Over a million combustion engine its right there in the name car fires per year thousands of deaths but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines Why the double standard This is a real question
Those who predicted Tesla EVs would be dead autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for month delays while ignoring major automakers years late Why the double standard
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars autonomy was between years never

Falcon lands on droneship but the lockout collet doesnt latch on one the four legs causing it
RT SpaceX First stage approaches center of landing droneship in Pacific
stuntpenguin LayOnOverWhale Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage but payload would be greatly reduced
JimmyVosika Actually didnt get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed
If speed at stage separation kmhr With a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to kmh
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions Altitude distance dont mean much for orbit All about speed
mbhnyc steel collet
Well at least the pieces were bigger this time Wont be last RUD but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing
UncleGus probably
However that was not what prevented it being good Touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didnt latch so it tipped over after landing
Definitely harder to land on a ship Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land much smaller target area thats also translating rotating

Am thinking of doing a movie sequel of sorts to Thank You for Smoking That was bad CO for indiv this for the planet
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change
Yeah climate change should really be considered a centrist issue as it affects everyone
Am not suggesting shutting down CO production but rather to price in environmental cost shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of we should still take immediate action as there is only one atmosphere
Right question to ask Dyson or others what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about any subject That is not the point

CosmicRami Awesome We really need to promote that fact in the US A CO tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt
Would love to do a pickup truck Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling dynamic air suspension mega torque
Technically I got rich from Zip PayPal w zero govt anything then put of that into SpaceX Tesla SolarCity
If consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low We should prob not have tax on basic foods critical meds
ponder Carbon produced by a SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one flight No we should not be exempt
Net of gas savings a Tesla is to month with down payment taken care of by tax credits Maybe less costly then it first seems
Yes am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created Market will then achieve best solution
Trees are net consumers of CO so technically we would pay them money
Exactly Seems crazy to risk the CO chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases ie consumption Much better to emphasize the latter
MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator
Me other private money funded Tesla for first years got IPO govt money for now paid back Yes carbon tax would be a better way
grayj There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years just like we do a census
Weight of scientific evidence Taxes dont ban a purchase they just increase cost Am against bans except in extreme cases
Exactly Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths Let market decide
Perhaps I am in favor of fair simple taxes that are neutral on most things incent good disincent bad
